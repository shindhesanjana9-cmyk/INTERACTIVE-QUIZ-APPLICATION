*DESCRIPTION*:
This project is a simple and interactive web-based quiz application developed using three main front-end web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These three tools work together to create the structure, appearance, and functionality of the quiz so that it can run smoothly inside any web browser. HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is used to build the basic structure of the webpage. It organizes the content into different sections such as the heading, quiz container, timer display, question area, answer options, score display, and restart button. In this project, HTML acts as the backbone that holds all elements together. It uses tags like div, button, span, and heading elements to arrange and display the quiz content in a clear and structured way. Without HTML, the webpage would not have any visible content or proper organization.

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to design and improve the visual appearance of the webpage. It controls how the quiz looks to the user by managing colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, borders, and interactive effects. In this quiz project, CSS is responsible for making the interface clean and attractive by centering the quiz container on the screen, giving it a white background, rounded corners, and a soft shadow effect. It also styles the answer option buttons so that they change color when the user hovers over them, creating a smooth and engaging user experience. The background color of the page, the font style of the text, and the spacing between elements are all controlled using CSS. By separating design from structure, CSS makes the webpage easier to maintain and enhances its overall visual quality.

JavaScript plays the most important role in this project because it provides interactivity and controls how the quiz actually works. While HTML creates the structure and CSS handles the design, JavaScript manages the logic and behavior of the application. It is responsible for displaying questions one by one, generating answer options dynamically, checking whether the selected answer is correct, updating the score, controlling the countdown timer, and showing the final result at the end of the quiz. In this project, JavaScript uses an array to store questions, answer options, and correct answers. Functions are used to load each question, create clickable buttons for options, and detect when a user selects an answer. It compares the selected option with the correct answer and updates the score accordingly. JavaScript also controls a timer that counts down every second, adding excitement and time pressure for users. When the quiz ends, either by completing all questions or when time runs out, JavaScript hides the quiz content and displays the final score along with a restart button that allows users to retake the quiz without refreshing the page.

This project can be created using any simple text editor, such as Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code. After writing the code, the file is saved with a .html extension and opened directly in any web browser like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. Since this is a front-end project, it does not require a database, server, or internet connection to run, making it easy to develop and test.

The quiz application has many real-world uses. In education, teachers can use it for online tests, practice quizzes, and student assessments. In e-learning platforms, quizzes help evaluate learners’ understanding after completing lessons. Companies can use similar systems for employee training and recruitment tests. It can also be used for entertainment purposes such as online trivia games. Overall, this project is very useful for beginners learning web development because it teaches important concepts like arrays, conditions, loops, event handling, timers, and dynamic content updates while building a practical and interactive application.
